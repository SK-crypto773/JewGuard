# JewGuard

## Inspiration
The Holocaust was a huge issue during WWII and over 5 million Jewish people were lost due to this event. For those who don't know what the holocaust is, the holocaust is a World War II genocide of the European Jews. We were thinking of an innovative idea that would've saved lives during that time. We felt that there was a need to make a website that could be accessible by many Jews. This problem is what inspired us to make this user-friendly interface.

## What it does
JewGuard offers an ideal way to inform Jews during the Holocaust. The website includes a map with markers pointing to Nazi locations and when they were posted. Users can put a Nazi alert and the website will verify if the post is from a Nazi spy or an actual Jew. In addition, the website holds a blog page where people can create posts. This website will only be available to Jews.

## How we built it
We used the Google Cloud Platform along with Firebase for this project.
* Firebase
  * Realtime Database
    * Stores information of the posts
    * Retreives the same information so users can see the post
  * Cloud Functions

* Other GCP
  * Google Maps API

Bootstrap HTML/CSS/JS
* Bootstrap Framework
  * Use of JQuery
  * Frontend Framework

GitHub
  * File Management
  * Hosting

 Node Js
 * Firebase Modules

## Challenges we ran into
There were many challenges we ran into, but that's what programming's all about. One of the difficult challenges we ran into was making sure the UI worked. Another challenge was figuring out how to embed the website with markers that denoted locations of Nazis.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of so many things. We made use of this project to the best of our abilities in the amount of time alloted. We got to use the Google Cloud Platform, which is a first for all of us, we had never used GCP before and now we will continue to use this platform. Additionally, we combined all of our skills to create a website that uses multiple frameworks and we are proud of this website. We love the UI/UX and we love the Backend, it was our first time as well using these frameworks. Finally, we are proud of the amount of work we pulled of in 24 hours. We would have never thought we could accmplish this much in such a small amount of time with team effort.
